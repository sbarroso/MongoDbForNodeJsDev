Get the MongoMart application up and running. It doesn't do much (yet), but you should be able to run it and experiment with the UI.

Download the MongoMart application from the handout.
Install the dependencies.
Make sure you have a mongod running version 3.2.x of MongoDB and using the WiredTiger (default for 3.2) storage engine.
Import the item collection: mongoimport -d mongomart -c item --maintainInsertionOrder data/items.json
Import the cart collection: mongoimport -d mongomart -c cart --maintainInsertionOrder data/cart.json
Run the application by typing "node mongomart.js" in the mongomart directory.
